Create a console (no UI necessary) application for a game in which one player moves a single piece
around a chessboard. Other than the use of a chessboard, there are no similarities between this
game and chess. Instead the rules of the game are as follows:

- The board is 8 by 8 in size
- A player starts on the bottom-left square
- A player can move their piece up, down, left or right one square by entering U, D, L or R
respectively
- A random number of squares are ‘landmines’
- The aim of the game is to get to the top side of the board without hitting more than 2
landmines.
- Following each move the game displays the new location and whether any landmines were hit,
plus whether the game has been lost (more than 2 land mines hit) or won (reached the top of
the board)

The game should be coded in C# or Java using automated testing and SOLID principles that ensure
the game can be extended in the future without compromising development efficiency or quality. It
is more important to demonstrate proficiency in these areas than to complete all the functionality
described above. Candidates can concentrate on coding the ‘happy path’ only and assume all input is
correctly formatted.
